## Android Five Stars Library

Android Five Stars Library is a small library that helps developers add a **"Rate My App"** dialog to their applications.

It's called "Five Stars" because the dialog has a different behaviour based on the rating given by the user.

If the user gives **4 or 5 stars out of 5**, the user is sent to the *Google Play Store* page to give an actual rating.

If the user gives **3 or less stars out of 5**, the user is asked to *send a bug report* to the developer.

If "Force Mode" is activated, when the user selects 4/5 stars, he is immediately redirected to the Play Store, without asking for a confirm. :D

## Installation

To use the library, first include it your project using Gradle


    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.Angtrim:Android-Five-Stars-Library:v3.1'
	}



## How to use
To use this library just add this snippet in the `onCreate` of your activity.

The `showAfter(int numbersOfAccess)` method tells the library after how many access the dialog has to be shown.

Example:

```java
        new FiveStarsDialog.Builder(this)
                        .withAppName(appName)
                        .withSupportEmail(supportEmail)
                        .withNegativeReviewListener(this) // OVERRIDE mail intent for negative review
                        .withReviewListener(this) // Used to listen for reviews (if you want to track them )
                        .withUpperBound(5) // Market opened if a rating >= 5 is selected
                        .showAfter(0);
```
## Features

The library is very simple, just note that :
* When the user tap OK or NEVER the dialog will not show again
* When the user tap NOT NOW the access counter will be reset and the dialog will be shown again after the selected times.
